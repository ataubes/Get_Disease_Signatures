#this pipeline is used to refine disease genes that will be used in drug predictions.
#two different sets of disease genes will be used to query CMap and LINCS
#disease gene signatures are essential in the prediction. External sets should be used to validate disease signatures.

#choose thresholds that lead to the best separation of tumor/non-tumors using external sets from GEO
#need to reload processed data

#choose thresholds for LINCS 

#validate disease signatures using the optimal thresholds

#validate reduced disease signatures using the optimal thresholds

#validate disease signatures using TCGA 

#validate reduced disease signatures using TCGA
